# Executive Summary: Test and Use Case Documentation

## AI-Powered WhatsApp Chatbot for South African Higher Education Institutions

This document provides an executive summary of the test and use case modeling developed for the AI-Powered WhatsApp Chatbot system. This work builds directly on previous assignments that established stakeholder needs and system requirements.

### Key Components Developed

1. **Use Case Diagram**
   - Comprehensive UML model showing 7 actors and 12 use cases
   - Clear visualization of system interactions and relationships
   - Alignment with stakeholder concerns identified in Assignment 4

2. **Detailed Use Case Specifications**
   - Eight critical use cases fully documented with:
     - Descriptions and scope boundaries
     - Pre and postconditions
     - Basic flow (happy path scenarios)
     - Alternative flows (exception handling)
   - Coverage of key functionality from student queries to system administration

3. **Test Cases**
   - Ten functional test cases tied directly to requirements
   - Eight non-functional test cases covering performance, security, and usability
   - Traceability matrix connecting stakeholder concerns to test coverage

### Strategic Value

This documentation provides several key benefits:

1. **Alignment with Stakeholder Needs**
   - Each use case addresses specific stakeholder concerns identified in earlier phases
   - Test cases validate that requirements will meet actual user needs

2. **Development Guidance**
   - Detailed use cases provide clear direction for implementation teams
   - Alternative flows ensure robust handling of exceptions and edge cases

3. **Quality Assurance Framework**
   - Test cases establish clear validation criteria for system acceptance
   - Comprehensive coverage of both functional and non-functional aspects

4. **Communication Tool**
   - Provides accessible explanation of system functionality for non-technical stakeholders
   - Creates shared understanding of system behavior across implementation teams

### Next Steps

1. Review use cases and test plans with key stakeholders for validation
2. Integrate use case specifications into development planning
3. Implement test cases within the QA framework
4. Establish ongoing traceability between requirements, use cases, and test results

This documentation forms a critical bridge between requirements definition and system implementation, ensuring that the developed system will effectively meet the needs of South African higher education institutions and their students.
