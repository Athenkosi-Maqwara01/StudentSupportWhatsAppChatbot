## Selected Template Justification: Automated Kanban

For the AI-Powered WhatsApp Chatbot for South African Higher Education Institutions project, I've selected the **Automated Kanban** template as the most suitable option for the following reasons:

### Why Automated Kanban is the Best Fit

1. **Balanced Complexity**: The project has moderate complexity with multiple components (WhatsApp integration, NLP processing, university system connections), making Basic Kanban too simplistic while Team Planning might introduce unnecessary complexity for our initial development phases.

2. **Automation Benefits**: The automated movement of issues based on pull request status will streamline our development workflow. When developers create a PR related to an issue, the system automatically moves it to "In Progress," and when the PR is merged, it moves to "Done." This reduces manual board management and keeps the status accurate.

3. **Development Focus**: Our project is currently in the early development phase where code implementation is a primary focus. The automation features specifically benefit code-related workflows, which aligns with our sprint planning from Assignment 6.

4. **Agile Methodology Alignment**: The Automated Kanban template supports our Agile approach by:
   - Facilitating continuous delivery through automated progress tracking
   - Providing clear visualization of task status
   - Supporting incremental development while maintaining workflow visibility

5. **Scalability**: As our project grows, Automated Kanban can be customized with additional columns to accommodate more complex workflows while maintaining its core automation benefits.

The Automated Kanban template provides the right balance of structure and flexibility for our project requirements. It supports our development-focused tasks while offering automation that reduces administrative overhead, allowing the team to focus on delivering value.
