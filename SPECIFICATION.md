### Project Title:
**Student Support WhatsApp Chatbot:**
***An AI-Powered WhatsApp Chatbot for Enhancing Student Support in South African Higher Education Institutions***

### Domain:
**Higher Education**

This system is designed for universities and colleges in South Africa to enhance student engagement and streamline communication between students and academic institutions.

### Problem Statement:

This project aims to develop an AI-powered chatbot that can provide real-time, accurate responses to common student queries via WhatsApp.

### Individual Scope & Feasibility Justification:
The chatbot will be developed using a combination of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **machine learning models** to ensure accurate responses. It will integrate with university databases and APIs to provide relevant information. The feasibility is high due to the increasing use of WhatsApp among students and the advancements in AI chatbot technologies.
