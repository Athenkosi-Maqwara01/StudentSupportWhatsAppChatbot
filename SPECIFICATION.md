# System Specification

## 1. Introduction
### Project Title:
**Student Support WhatsApp Chatbot:**
***An AI-Powered WhatsApp Chatbot for Enhancing Student Support in South African Higher Education Institutions***

### Domain  
**Higher Education** â€“ This system is designed for universities and colleges in South Africa to enhance student engagement and streamline communication between students and academic institutions.  

### Problem Statement  
Many students struggle with getting timely responses to administrative and academic queries. Traditional support systems, such as emails and help desks, often lead to long response times and administrative bottlenecks. This project aims to develop an AI-powered chatbot that can provide real-time, accurate responses to common student queries via WhatsApp, a platform already widely used by South African students.  

### Individual Scope & Feasibility Justification  
The chatbot will be developed using a combination of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning models to ensure accurate responses. It will integrate with university databases and APIs to provide relevant information. The feasibility is high due to:

- Widespread use of WhatsApp among South African students  
- Advancements in AI chatbot technologies  
- Availability of integration options with university systems  
- Scalable deployment options for higher education institutions  

## 2. System Overview
